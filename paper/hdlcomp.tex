\begin{abstract}
Since decades we use VHDL and Verilog as the main entry
languages for hardware design. However, those are old languages
originally not designed for synthesize. In the mean time the software
community has made big improvements in programming languages
resulting in increased productivity.

Can we leverage some of the development in programming
languages for hardware description? Several new hardware
description languages (HDL), based on software programming
languages, are proposed. In this paper we evaluate these
new HDLs and asses if they are ready for prime time.

\section{General}

Do some exploration of user base and available source code on all languages.

How many \emph{background} knowledge on programming language do we need for the new HDL?

Can it be a language to teach 1st and 2nd semester EE students to learn digital
electronics? Even without programming background? We now struggle with VHDL.

\section{Introduction}

Verilog and VHDL has served us decades as the main languages for designing
digital systems. However, both languages have a large legacy and might not be
the most efficient languages to (1) build large digital systems and (2) to learn
hardware design.

In the software domain there has been a boom in new programming languages
in the last years. Programmers are more flexible now to change programming
languages when the job to been done is simplified. Within the hardware design
community a new HDL has a hard time to get established. As there is a way
smaller user base simulation and synthesize tools vendors are reluctant to
support a new HDL.

However, in recent year there have ben new approaches to use modern
languages as a basis for hardware design. The HDL is \emph{embedded}
in those new languages. The tool supporting this HDLs usually provide
support for simulation. For synthesize of hardware VHDL or Verilog is
generated. Therefore, the \emph{old} HDLs serve as an intermediate
language to have the full support of synthesize tools.

This paper compares modern hardware description languages and
assesses if they are mature and useful for FPGA designs.

The question is: is hardware design more productive with those new
languages? Are these languages mature enough for real world designs?
In this paper we explore several new HDLs in the context of hardware
design with FPGAs. When switching to a new design methodology one
wants to minimize risk and dependency on a a singe vendor. Open source
projects fulfill the role of risk minimization. In the worst case one can hire
someone to fix a bug in the HDL. Therefore, we restrict our language survey
to open-source projects.

\subsection{Assessment Criteria}


In synchronous design the two basic building blocks are combinational
(asynchronous) logic and flip-flop based registers. Larger on-chip
memories are not built out of registers, but are considered another building
block. This building blocks are also reflected in current FPGAs: lookup tables
(LUT) are used to implement combinational functions, dedicated flip-flops
the registers, on-chip memories support larger storage requirements,
and dedicated hard macros (with MAC operations) support efficient
implementation of DSP algorithms.

This results in following questions:
\begin{itemize}
\item Is it clear what is combinational logic and what are registers?
\item Can FPGA block RAMs be instantiated? Can ROMs be used?
\item Can the DSP blocks be used?
\end{itemize}

\todo{Write some text around the questions as motivation for them}

Further questions to be answered:

\begin{itemize}
\item Is simulation in the HDL possible?
\item Is there a clear line between the synthsizable  and not synthsizable parts of the language?
\item Can it be used in a first semester digital electronics course?
\item What about programming in the large? Are name spaces supported?
\item Quality of generated code: hardware resources and maximum clock frequency
\item Mixed language (with VHDL and/or Verilog) usage?
\item Size of the user group and support
\item Active development
\end{itemize}

Missing and hard to assess: productivity, easy to maintain.

\section{Getting Started}

This is a first tour through the languages.

\subsection{MyHDL}

Starting with MyHDL was a pleasure. Having Python already installed, the installation
of MyHDL was a matter of minutes. Having been exposed to Python for about one
day before, the first examples from the MyHDL manual~\cite{myhdl:2010} where easy as well.
However, jumping ahead and trying to generate some real VHDL code and programming
an FPGA with the HW version of \emph{Hello World} took some hours struggling
with cryptic error messages. The author is used to statically typed languages and
compile checks, where Pythons dynamic typing and interpreting execution model
reveals program and even typing errors only at runtime needs some adaption of
the authors programming mindset and habits.

The development approach in MyHDL is to test and verify the hardware within Python first
before generating VHDL or Verilog. Therefore, basic Python language knowledge is
needed for MyHDL. In fact MyHDL is less a language in its own, but a Python package.

\todo{Maybe this goes into a Discussion section at the end}

The question is if a dynamic typed language, where a variable can change the type
at runtime, the best base for HW synthesis is. In the resulting Verilog/VHDL code and
in the hardware the type of a signal or a register is statically fixed. Type errors in
Python are only detected at runtime by extensive testing. In a statically typed
language the compiler finds all type errors at compile time.

\todo{Comment: Python is easy going with dynamic typing and test benches run.
However, when converting to VHDL or Verilog, types (i.e., lengths of bit vectors)
need to be specified. As a result after high level simulation more work is needed
to have synthesizable code.}


MyHDL takes a very software oriented approach to hardware design. The emphasis
is on unit test, which is a new a interesting approach in hardware design.
However, teaching digital electronic with VHDL showed the issues of students
thinking to much in the term of a \emph{program} instead of the hardware
structure. We think a HDL shall describe the actual structure and not an
algorithm in form of a software program.


\begin{itemize}
\item Very simple to download install
\item Python needs to be learned, some VHDL/Verilog knowledge is still needed
\end{itemize}

Installed on Python 2.7. Does it need a 2.x Python or would it run on 3.x as well?

How large is the user base on MyHDL? Any open-source projects?

see \url{http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.python.myhdl/2701}

\subsubsection{Remarks}

Why does the manual show code for a simple mix that is not convertible to VHDL?

This is not the way we would like the process for synchronous logic:

\begin{verbatim}
FOO_HDL: process (clk, reset) is
begin
    if (reset = '1') then
        sig <= '0';
    elsif rising_edge(clk)or falling_edge(reset) then
        sig <= to_std_logic((not to_boolean(sig)));
    end if;
end process FOO_HDL;
\end{verbatim}

The MyHDL manual introduces too early, too many non-synthesizable constructs.
They might be good for test benches, but that should be stated more explicit.

Positive is conversion to VHDL and Verilog.

\subsection{Chisel}

Chisel is a HDL developed at the University of California, Berkeley~\cite{chisel:dac2012}.
Chisel is embedded in Scala.

As the language is a research vehicle and mainly used internally, getting
started just with the tutorial is harder than getting started with MyHDL.
Besides learning Chisel, some knowledge of Scala is needed. Furthermore,
the tool flow for Chisel is based on the build tool sbt, which itself needs to
be learned.

The tutorial for Chisel is already a complex set of exercises, solution, and
automation for building those exercises. In our opinion this starts with a
too steep learning course. Therefore, we have cut down the tutorial to
the minimum of a hardware \emph{Hello World} program: a blinking LED
on an FPGA board.\footnote{This Chisel Hello World introduction is
available as part of our HDL comparison code at:
\url{https://github.com/schoeberl/comphdl/tree/master/hello-chisel}}

\todo{The tutorial starts too complex.}

\martin{Are enums missing? Does the bit width always need to be known?}

\martin{Check if asynchronous or synchronous reset is used.}

\martin{Looks like synchronous reset is used. That's bad :-(}

\subsubsection{Issues, Questions}

The automatic inference of the correct bit length can lead to surprising
results. ``val r1 = Reg(resetVal = UFix(0, size))'' describes a register with
size bits, but the expression ``val r1 = Reg(UFix(0, size))'' results in a single
bit register.

\subsubsection{FlexPRET/Chisel Questions}

Why are the pipeline registers individual gals per filed? Why not a Bundle,
which could also be used for component IO?

\subsection{Lava}

Lava is a HDL based on Haskell~\cite{Lava:1998}. The first version described
is focused on verification and does not yet support description of sequential
hardware. \todo{Assume that this is all gone and there are some more papers.}

\martin{Looks like this Lava thing is tight with Xilinx. VHDL code generation
is also mentioned.}

\section{Language Assessments}

In this section we will assess which languages fulfill the criteria proposed in
the introduction and answer the questions.

\subsection{Is it clear what is combinational logic and what are registers?}

\todo{Check Verilog}

In VHDL there is no clear distinction between combinational logic, flip-flop
registers,  and memories in the language. Registers (and memories) are
inferred from \emph{code patterns}. Furthermore, small errors can result
in unintended latches generated in processes that are intended to be combinational.

MyHDL has no distinct types for register of memory. However, it uses annotations
(so called decorators in Python) to mark a function representing
combinational logic with \code{@always\_comb} and a function where the
output is stored in registers with \code{@always(clk.posedge)}. We consider
this as an enhancement related to VHDL/Verilog \todo{Check Verilog}.

\subsection{Documentation and Tutorials}

The MyHDL distribution contains a mental~\cite{myhdl:2010} that includes
a tutroal.

\subsection{Active Community}

It is important that a new language has a active developer group that is
able to fix errors and incorporate changes when new (FPGA) technology
becomes available. Furthermore, an active forum for the language users
is beneficial for getting started.

MyHDL is developed and maintained by Jan Decaluwe with the help of
Christopher Felton.  

\section{Notes (from iPad/Dropbox)}

MyHDL

Having min and max values that cannot be implemented so in HW is strange. I would prefer just signed/unsigned with a power of 2 range.

MyHDL is not a new language, but a python package. Python is the language. If a HW description is embedded in a full blown general purpose language with a lot of libraries, how easy is it to see the boundaries of what is synthesizable hardware, what is test benches, unit tests, and even generator code?

There is no indication is parameters are input or output signals.

Testing looks convenient with all the Python support.

Are signal records/structures possible?

A dynamic (scripting) language depends very much on unit tests. Even typos are only
discovered when the code is executed. Static typed languages (such as Java
and Scala) can catch quite a lot of bugs and typos during compilation.

General

Is tri state supported?

Shall I look into C based HDLs?

SystemC?

SystemVerilog
