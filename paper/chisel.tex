\begin{abstract}
this paper is a collection of notes and comments on the Chisel HDL.
Maybe this will be useful for a future Chisel manual.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Chisel is a promising approach to raise the level of abstraction in
hardware design and therefore speedup the development of hardware
similar as modern software languages sped up software development.
Chisel is a HDL developed at the University of California, Berkeley~\cite{chisel:dac2012}.
In this paper we collect our experiences on learning and using Chisel.
The first Chisel project, after some small \emph{Hello World} examples,
is the recoding (and partially redesigning) of the Patmos RISC pipeline~\cite{patmos:ppes2011}.
\section{Comments}

What does tick() and what does step() do for testing?
  vars in step are input, the output is either set by the test bench to compare to, or set by the component output values when not set in the test bench.
How get to inner signals on testing?
What is the meaning if isTrace?

val x = expr is an assignment.
val y = type is a forward declaration
y := expr is then the assignment, := is called the wiring operator

The waveform shows the input of an register, not the output.
The waveform shows IO signals and registers.
The waveform shows only IO signals that are in use.

Try out multiple wiring operations, setup test play around with print of output, may be no -vcd now

This is the way to get a printable output:

\begin{verbatim}
      step(svars, ovars, false)
      val out = ovars(c.io.out).litValue()
\end{verbatim}


What is the meaning of data in Reg? Is it the input signal?

What does a step() when testing combinational circuits? Just change the input values, right? Clock is simply ignored.

Test bench is mix of Chisel and Scala code. The hardware description needs plain Chisel, 'no Scala constructs'. Which are the forbidden Scala constructs?

Hardware that is not really used is optimized away for the simulation.
This might be just a little bit inconvenient when signals cannot be seen in
the waveform. However, this is very annoying when it results in C code
that cannot be compiled.

1)What is a good way to monitor internal signals? for debugging

you can list the signals to monitor using the sequence args to Tester:

class GCDTests(c: GCD) extends Tester(c, Array(c.io)) ...

where you just add extra nodes to the Array. Â these will then appear in your ovars from calls to step:

Rewrite the above with the example talen from Patmos in chisel.

Take care that your components actually really extend Component. Otherwise
you get strange behavior.

Wrong code can fail in very different ways:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Silent, wrong syntax (or at least syntax with no meaning) can just behave strange
\item Error from chisel exploration, which it good
\item Java runtime exception, e.g., null pointer exception
\item C++ compile error. E.g., multiple definitions of a type in the include file or undefined
variables in the .cpp file. The late comes from HDL code that is not used (no output dependency)
\end{enumerate}

A tip for this: Compile often, after incremental changes. Introduce artificial
dependencies to keep code live, even when not finished.

Duplication of definitions in the .h file usually come from unconnected
io ports, which result from unused input ports.

Check out if conditional updates are just for registers or also for combinational circuits
-- they apply also for combinational circuits and must have defaults (independent of
full coverage).

Not setting a reset value results in not using reset, which is good for on-chip memories. Shown by Michael, check it out.

No default value on a forward declaration. It has to be explicit.

Is new now optional in Scala/Chisel? Check it. If yes, just drop it. At least for extending Bundle()
it is not optional.

How do Bundles and sub bundles actually work? When are those data structures allocated?
Is the declaration the constructor? Yes, the code not within a method is constructor code.
The whole chisel description is actually constructor code.

\section{Notes from Talk with Jonathan}

Questions:

* Usage of Bundles for interface and register ok?

Yes, looks like. No direction when the Bundle is used for a register as well.

* How to write a table?

VHDL:
process(address) begin

\begin{verbatim}
case address is
    when "0000000000" => q <= "00000011000000000000000000000001";
    when "0000000001" => q <= "00000000011110111101000000010000";
    when "0000000010" => q <= "00000010010100100000000000110000";
    when "0000000011" => q <= "00000010110000000000010010000000";

One way in chisel:

  val v = Vec(4) { Bits(width=32) }
  v(0) = Bits("h_0002_00ff")  // maybe not executed
  v(1) = Bits("h_0004_0001")  // addi    r2 = r0, 1;
  v(2) = Bits("h_0006_0002")  // addi    r3 = r0, 2;
  v(3) = Bits("h_0208_2180") // add     r4 = r2, r3;

But better to use ROM:

  val muls = new Array[UFix](256)
  for (x <- 0 until 16; y <- 0 until 16)
    muls((x << 4) | y) = x * y
  val tbl = ROM(muls){ UFix(8) }

\end{verbatim}

However, the ROM examples from the slides do not compile :-(

* Asynchronous reset -- it will be considered. I might do a patch for that.

* Issue sometimes with dead code - not in the waveform and may
result in a C compiler error. But would be nice during development and debugging

* Maybe use Chisel source for the project? Only useful when doing Chisel development.

* Waveform display of a register is one off (shows the input and not the output):
will be considered.
