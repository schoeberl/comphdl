Current hardware design is dominated by two languages, VHDL and Verilog,
which are about 30 years old. They have originaly not been designed for
hardware synthesis. Therefore, a lot of constructs in the languages cannot
be implemented in hardware and basic synthesizable constructs (combinational
logic, refisters, and memory) are are only 'infered' from code in a typical
style.

However, several projectsbuild on the active development of new languages for
classic software development and adapt it for hardware description langages (HDL).
This GitHub project is about getting an overview what is out on new tools and
trying to assess the pro and cons for individual languages.
